# Connection Refactoring Status

## Completed Steps

### 1. Created Connection Class ✓
- File: `src/connection.js`
- Encapsulates TCP connection logic
- Handles message buffering and parsing
- Provides connect, listen, send, and disconnect methods

### 2. Updated IDE Class ✓
- Added `ide.connection` instance
- Added `ide.send()` method that uses connection
- Added `ide.recv()` method for instance-specific message handling
- Added connection event handlers

### 3. Updated Global D.send ✓
- Now forwards to `D.ide.send()` when IDE exists
- Falls back to direct send during connection phase

### 4. Updated D.recv ✓
- Now forwards to `D.ide.recv()` when IDE exists
- Maintains backward compatibility

## Current State

The refactoring has made significant progress:
- Connection class handles all TCP communication
- IDE instances own their connections
- Protocol handshake moved to Connection class
- Connection establishment updated to use IDE's connection
- `initInterpreterConn` deprecated (renamed to `initInterpreterConn_DEPRECATED`)

### What's Working:
- Connection class with protocol handling
- IDE-owned connections
- Handshake in Connection class
- Basic message routing through IDE

### Still Using Global State:
- Global `clt` variable kept for backward compatibility
- Some error handlers still reference global `clt`
- Not all D.send calls have been migrated

## Completed Today

### Connection Refactoring ✓
1. **Moved handshake to Connection class**
   - Protocol negotiation in setupHandlers
   - Message parsing in processBuffer
   - Handshake completion detection

2. **Updated connection flows**
   - Connect: IDE creates connection directly
   - Listen: IDE's connection creates server
   - All flows use IDE-owned connections

3. **Deprecated initInterpreterConn**
   - Renamed to initInterpreterConn_DEPRECATED
   - Connection handling moved to Connection class
   - No longer called in connection flows

### Multi-Window Support ✓
1. **NSW Command Implementation**
   - Sends IPC message to create new window
   - Each window is independent BrowserWindow

2. **Main Process Handler**
   - Creates new session windows
   - Sends init-session message to renderer
   - Tracks windows with WindowManager

3. **Renderer Initialization**
   - Handles init-session message
   - Shows connection dialog for new windows
   - Each window gets its own IDE instance

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Remove Global State
1. **Remove global clt variable**
   - Currently kept for backward compatibility
   - Replace remaining references with IDE's connection
   - Update error handlers

### Phase 2: Update Protocol Handlers
- Find all D.send calls (~200+)
- Update to use ide.send or D.ide.send
- Test each protocol handler

### Phase 3: Test Multi-Window
- Test connecting multiple windows to different interpreters
- Verify windows are independent
- Test window closing and cleanup

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Single connection works
- [ ] Can execute commands
- [ ] Can open editors
- [ ] Debugger works
- [ ] Workspace explorer works
- [ ] Connection errors handled properly
- [ ] Can disconnect and reconnect

## Known Issues

1. Connection establishment still uses global state
2. Some protocol handlers may still expect global state
3. Error handling needs review
4. Multi-window not yet implemented
